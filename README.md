# Hello World API: Symfony + PHP Sample

This sample uses [auth0/jwt-auth-bundle](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-auth-bundle) package to implement the following security tasks:

- Auth0 library:
    - [auth0/jwt-auth-bundle](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-auth-bundle)


This branch offers a working API server that exposes a public endpoint along with two protected endpoints. Each endpoint returns a different type of message: public, protected, and admin.

The `GET /api/messages/protected` and `GET /api/messages/admin` endpoints are protected against unauthorized access. Any requests that contain a valid access token in their authorization header can access the protected and admin data.

Additionally, the `GET /api/messages/admin` endpoint requires the access tokens to contain a `read:admin-messages` permission in order to access the admin data, which is referred to as [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/rbac/).

## Quick Auth0 Set Up

### Prerequisite

Ensure that you have Symfony CLI installed on your System. Follow the instruction [here](https://symfony.com/download) to download it.

### Set up the project

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Next, create a new file named `.env.local` and replace its content with the details in `.env` file. You can issue this command for that:

```bash
cp .env .env.local
```

Once you are done, open `.env.local` file and update the values of the environment variables below:

```bash
CLIENT_ORIGIN_URL=http://localhost:4040
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=http://localhost:6060
AUTH0_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_AUTH0_ID
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Ensure to replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `YOUR_AUTH0_ID`, and `YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` placeholders with the appropriate from your Auth0 dashboard


### Register a(n) Symfony API with Auth0

- Open the [APIs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis) section of the Auth0 Dashboard.

- Click on the **Create API** button.

- Provide a **Name** value such as _Hello World API Server_.

- Set its **Identifier** to `https://api.example.com` or any other value of your liking.

- Leave the signing algorithm as `RS256` as it's the best option from a security standpoint.

- Click on the **Create** button.

> View ["Register APIs" document](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/set-up-apis) for more details.

### Connect Symfony with Auth0

Head back to your Auth0 API page, and **follow these steps to get the Auth0 Audience**:

![Get the Auth0 Audience to configure an API](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-user-authentication/get-the-auth0-audience.png)

1. Click on the **"Settings"** tab.

2. Locate the **"Identifier"** field and copy its value.

3. Paste the "Identifier" value as the value of `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` in `.env.local`.

Now, **follow these steps to get the Auth0 Domain value**:

![Get the Auth0 Domain to configure an API](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-user-authentication/get-the-auth0-domain.png)

1. Click on the **"Test"** tab.
2. Locate the section called **"Asking Auth0 for tokens from my application"**.
3. Click on the **cURL** tab to show a mock `POST` request.
4. Copy your Auth0 domain, which is _part_ of the `--url` parameter value: `tenant-name.region.auth0.com`.
5. Paste the Auth0 domain value as the value of `AUTH0_DOMAIN` in `.env.local`.

**Tips to get the Auth0 Domain**

- The Auth0 Domain is the substring between the protocol, `https://` and the path `/oauth/token`.

- The Auth0 Domain follows this pattern: `tenant-name.region.auth0.com`.

- The `region` subdomain (`au`, `us`, or `eu`) is optional. Some Auth0 Domains don't have it.

### Run the project

With the `.env` configuration values set, run the API server by issuing the following command:

```bash
symfony server:start --port=6060
```

The port flag will ensure that the application runs on [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060)

## Test the Protected Endpoints

You can get an access token from the Auth0 Dashboard to test making a secure call to your protected API endpoints.

Head back to your Auth0 API page and click on the "Test" tab.

Locate the section called "Sending the token to the API".

Click on the cURL tab of the code box.

Copy the sample cURL command:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://path_to_your_api/ \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer really-long-string-which-is-test-your-access-token'
```

Replace the value of `http://path_to_your_api/` with your protected API endpoint path (you can find all the available API endpoints in the next section) and execute the command. You should receive back a successful response from the server.

You can try out any of our full stack demos to see the client-server Auth0 workflow in action using your preferred front-end and back-end technologies.

## Test the Admin Endpoint

The `GET /api/messages/admin` endpoint requires the access token to contain the `read:admin-messages` permission. The best way to simulate that client-server secured request is to use any of the Hello World client demo apps to log in as a user that has that permission.

You can use the Auth0 Dashboard to create an `admin` role and assign it the`read:admin-messages` permission. Then, you can assign the `admin` role to any user that you want to access the `/admin` endpoint.

- [Create permissions](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/dashboard/add-api-permissions)

## API Endpoints

### 🔓 Get public message

```bash
GET /api/messages/public
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "message": "The API doesn't require an access token to share this message."
}
```

> 🔐 Protected Endpoints: These endpoints require the request to include an access token issued by Auth0 in the authorization header.

### 🔐 Get protected message

```bash
GET /api/messages/protected
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "message": "The API successfully validated your access token."
}
```

### 🔐 Get admin message

> Requires the user to have the `read:admin-messages` permission.

```bash
GET /api/messages/admin
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "message": "The API successfully recognized you as an admin."
}
```
  
## Error Handling
