# Hello World API: Symfony + PHP Sample

You can use this sample project to learn how to secure a simple Symfony API server using Auth0.

The `starter` branch offers a working API server that exposes three public endpoints. Each endpoint returns a different type of message: public, protected, and admin.

The goal is to use Auth0 to only allow requests that contain a valid access token in their authorization header to access the protected and admin data. Additionally, only access tokens that contain a `read:admin-messages` permission should access the admin data, which is referred to as [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/rbac/).

[Check out the `add-authorization` branch](https://github.com/yemiwebby/api-server-symfony/tree/add-authorization) to see authorization in action using Auth0.

[Check out the `add-rbac` branch](https://github.com/yemiwebby/api-server-symfony/tree/add-rbac) to see authorization and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in action using Auth0.

### Prerequisite

Ensure that you have Symfony CLI installed on your System. Follow the instruction [here](https://symfony.com/download) to download it.

## Get Started
Install the project dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Next, create a new file named `.env.local` and replace its content with the details in `.env` file. You can issue this command for that:

```bash
cp .env .env.local
```

## API Endpoints

The API server defines the following endpoints:

### ðŸ”“ Get public message

```bash
GET /api/messages/public
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "message": "The API doesn't require an access token to share this message."
}
```

### ðŸ”“ Get protected message

> You need to protect this endpoint using Auth0.

```bash
GET /api/messages/protected
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "message": "The API successfully validated your access token."
}
```

### ðŸ”“ Get admin message

> You need to protect this endpoint using Auth0 and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

```bash
GET /api/messages/admin
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "message": "The API successfully recognized you as an admin."
}
```

## Error Handling

### 400s errors

#### Response

```bash
Status: Corresponding 400 status code
```

```json
{
  "message": "Message that describes the error that took place."
}
```

### 500s errors

#### Response

Status: 500 Internal Server Error
```
